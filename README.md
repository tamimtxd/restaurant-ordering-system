## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1.  **Push to GitHub**:
    - Create a new repository on GitHub.
    - Run the following commands in your terminal (replace `<USERNAME>` and `<REPO>` with your details):
      ```bash
      git remote add origin https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>.git
      git branch -M main
      git push -u origin main
      ```

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    - Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
    - Navigate to "Pages" (usually under the "Code and automation" section).
    - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
    - Select the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder.
    - Click "Save".

3.  **View Your Site**:
    - GitHub will provide a URL (e.g., `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>/`).
    - It might take a minute or two for the site to go live.
